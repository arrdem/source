anosql
======

A Python library for using SQL

Inspired by the excellent Yesql library by Kris Jenkins. In my mother tongue, ano means yes.

This is a vendored copy of `anosql`_, which exists to capture a few pre-deprecation patches that never made it into the last release, and bazel-ify everything for my use.
