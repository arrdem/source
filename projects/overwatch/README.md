# Overwatch

> Overwatch is a force protection tactic in modern warfare where one small unit or military vehicle supports another while it is executing fire and movement tactics.
> An overwatching unit takes a position where it can observe the terrain ahead, especially likely enemy positions.
> This allows it to provide effective covering fire for advancing friendly units.
> The term "overwatch" was coined in U.S. military doctrine in the 1950s.

Overwatch is a monitoring and intervention system.

Like its namesake, it seeks to provide a baseline of support for other automation - although initial versions will likely implement their own interventions.
