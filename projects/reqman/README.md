# Req[uirements] Man[ager]

A tool designed to be a one-stop-shop interface for managing `requirements.txt` in a monorepo.
Provides a convenient way to check formatting, apply formatting, expunge unused requirements and add new requirements.

Inspired in some part by the `pip-tools` project's `pip-compile`; but designed to not make you do any intermediate file dancing.
