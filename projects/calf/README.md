# Calf

> Calf: Noun.
A young cow or ox.

Before I walked from the Clojure space, I kept throwing around the idea of "ox", an ur-clojure.
Ox was supposed to experiment with some stuff around immutable namespaces and code as data which never came to fruition.
I found the JVM environment burdensome, difficult to maintain velocity in, and my own ideas too un-formed to fit well into a rigorous object model.

Calf is a testbed.
It's supposed to be a lightweight, unstable, easy for me to hack on substrate for exploring those old ideas and some new ones.
